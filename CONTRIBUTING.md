# Contributing to OllamaChat

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OllamaChat! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/ollamachat/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/ollamachat/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow by everyone. Plus, it allows us to automatically generate changelogs.

The commit message format is as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

The `<type>` must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Example: `feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication`

### Code Style

- Follow the `ESLint` rules provided in the project.
- Keep code clean, commented, and easy to understand.

We appreciate your contributions!
